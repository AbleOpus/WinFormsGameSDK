# WinFormsGameSDK
A simple WinForms game SDK with a zombie survival game demo.
Just for fun, I wrote a game SDK and a top-down zombie shooter. I decided to post the source since people were interested in the demo application. 
## The Zombie Survival Game
This is a simple game where zombies spawn-in and you kill them. The player and teammate both have automatic pistols. Use these pistols to shoot the zombies in the face. There is also a truck that can be entered and driven around.
### Input bindings:  
__Left-mouse click:__ Shoot.  
__E:__ Use item.  
__F11:__ Toggle full-screen.  
__Ctrl + D:__ Toggle debug info.  
__Escape:__ Exit full-screen or application if not in full-screen.  
__W:__ Move forwards.  
__A:__ Move or turn left.  
__S:__ Move backwards.  
__D:__ Move or turn right.  
__Z:__ Toggle zombie spawner.  
### Issues
-	The collision system is messed up.
